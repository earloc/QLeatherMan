# QLeatherMan
The ~~swiss-army-knife~~ multi-tool of choice when dealing with GraphQL schemas in .NET-land.

![.NET Core](https://github.com/earloc/QLeatherMan/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)

## What is it?
QLeatherman, or short qlman, is a dotnet core cli-utility to help deailing with common tasks when GraphQL meets .NET (Core).

Main aspects are:
- easy-to-use from the start (via dotnet-tool)
- great interop with various build-pipelines
- OOTB generation of C#-clients given a GraphQL schema
- maintaining backwards-compatible GraphQL-schemas by providing automated reports of changes between two version of an API (you can, of course, compare two completely unrelated schemas, if that makes any sense to you ^^)

## How to get it?

### dotnet global tool
Run the follwoing command to download QLeatherman as a global dotnet-tool

```
dotnet tool install --global QLeatherman
```

### Examples
#### Generating C#-Clients
invoking the following command will generate a full C# client for a given schema:

```
dotnet qlman generate https://swapi.apis.guru/
```

> As QLeatherman currently completely relies on [GraphQlClientGenerator] when generating client-classes, head over there for details and donÂ´t forget to leave a

#### Comparing two (verions of) GraphQL-schema(s)

Invoking the following command will generate a report showing the current differences between the given schemas:

```
dotnet qlman compare https://swapi.apis.guru/ https://api.spacex.land/graphql/
```
> the sample comparison above does not actually make any sense, but showcases the output of differing schemas

During comparison, the used schemas are cached locally in **left**.json and **rigt**.json, respectiviley.

To use these local cached version, run the following command

```
dotnet qlman compare left.json https://swapi.apis.guru/
```

to compare the local file **left.json** with the remote-schema **https://swapi.apis.guru/**.
> Urls and files can be mixed and matched as needed.
