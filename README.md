# QLeatherMan
The ~~swiss-army-knife~~ leatherman when dealing with GraphQL schemas in .NET-land.

## What is it?
QLeatherman, or short qlman, is a dotnet core cli-utility to help deailing with common tasks when GraphQL meets .NET (Core).

Main aspects are:
- easy-to-use from the start (via dotnet-tool)
- great interop with various build-pipelines
- OOTB generation of C#-clients given a GraphQL schema
- maintaining backwards-compatible GraphQL-schemas by providing automated reports of changes between two version of an API (you can, of course, compare two completely unrelated schemas, if that makes any sense to you ^^)

### Examples
#### Generating C#-Clients
invoking the following command will generate a full C# client for a given schema:

```
dotnet qlman generate https://api.spacex.land/graphql
```

> As QLeatherman currently completely relies on [GraphQlClientGenerator] when generating client-classes, head over there for details and donÂ´t forget to leave a

#### Comparing two (verions of) GraphQL-schema(s)

Invoking the following command will generate a report showing the current differences between the given schemas:

```
dotnet qlman compare https://countries.trevorblades.com/ https://api.spacex.land/graphql/
```
